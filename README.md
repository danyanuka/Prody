Upload Files: When a user uploads a file, your backend should receive the file, save it to a shared location (e.g., a folder on your server, or a cloud storage bucket), and generate a unique identifier for the file. This unique identifier could be a filename or a database key.

Store Metadata: Store metadata about the uploaded files in your database. This metadata should include information such as the unique identifier (e.g., filename or database key), original filename, file type, size, and any other relevant information.

Provide Download Links: When a user wants to download a file, your frontend can display a list of files associated with the item/project, along with download links. These download links should point to a backend endpoint that serves the requested file from the shared location.

Serve Files: When a user requests to download a file, your backend endpoint should retrieve the file from the shared location based on the unique identifier, and stream it back to the user's browser as a download response.
